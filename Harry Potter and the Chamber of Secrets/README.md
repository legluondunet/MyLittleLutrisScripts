# Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets CD + DxWrapper + HP2 Wine fix
### Description:
Play "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" CD edition on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- Using "DxWrapper" and "HP2 Wine fix" for better graphic performance and stability
- You will need CD only one time during install
- This game does not natively support controller. I wrote Antimicrox profiles, you can download them here:
